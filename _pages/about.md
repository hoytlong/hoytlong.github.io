My research and teaching interests range from literature, media, and book history to platform studies, cultural analytics, and generative AI. My most recent book, [*The Values in Numbers: Reading Japanese Literature in a Global Information Age*](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-values-in-numbers/9780231193511/) (2021), offers both a reinterpretation of modern Japanese literature through computational methods and an introduction to the history, theory, and practice of looking at literature through numbers.<br> 
<br>Since then, I've written articles that rethink literary translation in the wake of neural machine translation, that explore how platforms are reshaping global televisual attention and response, and that consider the possibilities of generative AI for cultural co-intelligence. I'm currently collaborating on projects that include *Niche Worlds: How Streaming Platforms Changed Attention and Reception* and a set of studies that investigate the limits and affordances of large-language models as readers, writers, and instructors of literature.<br>
<br>I've published articles in a wide range of journals, including *Critical Inquiry*, *New Literary History*, *Positions*, *Journal of Japanese Studies*, *Journal of Asian Studies*, *Journal of Cultural Analytics*, *Public Books*, *Modern Language Quarterly*, and *PMLA*.
